### Model conversion  
As GPURuntime step of `AI Inference Server GPU accelerated` supports only ONNX models to run, we need to convert our model if it is created via other framework. In case your model is created via other framework, please find the most recent and appropriate converter on official [https://onnx.ai](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools.html#buildModel) pages.

- Our examples:
  - Keras to ONNX
  - PyTorch to ONNX
